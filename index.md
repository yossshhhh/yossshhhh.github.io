## **About Me**
Hi, I'm Adam! I'm currently a third year student at UC San Diego studying Cognitive Science w/ specialization in Machine Learning and minoring in Computer Science. I'm interested in Software Engineering, Data Science, as well as Computer Security. In my free time, I like to play hockey, write ~~sadtire~~ satire, and run. I also drive buses at UCSD.
